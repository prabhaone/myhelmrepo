Packages must be self-contained, and not require any additional external service in order to run.

It should be possible to simply start up a local cluster in [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/ "Minikube") and deploy it right away. At the same time it should be possible to
run them on any other Kubernetes based solution, in the real cloud.
